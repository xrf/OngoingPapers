Dear Editor,

Thank you very much for your letter on our manuscript LN14687.

This part is solely to the editor, and not to the referees.

We have decided to resubmit the paper to PRL after revisions based on 
the referee reports.   Actually a substantial revision has been made.
A summary of major changes and reply to Referee A are combined 
as shown below.

The tex file of the revised manuscript is attached as well as new eps 
files of all figures. 

We would like to ask for a new  Referee B due to the following reason.   
Referee B discussed advanced details of microscopic nuclear forces, 
but the report is not so relevant to the present work.   The present work 
has its focus on nuclear structure studies and 
needs basic features of nuclear forces as  input to our procedure 
based on the novel method, called EKK.  We actually took one of the 
standard forces as done in many other works published in the Physical Review Letters or Physical Review C (see for example Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 072501).  Since it is rather unlikely that 
Referee B will change her/his strong (personal) standpoint regarding 
nuclear forces, it should be much more productive to look for a more 
appropriate referee.

For completeness, we attach our reply to Referee B below.  This is only 
to the editors of PRL, and is the same as the paragraph above.  
Please do not send it to Referee B.

As candidates of such a suitable referee, we can nominate
    B.R.Barrett     (Tucson)   nuclear forces, ab initio shell model
    C. Johnson     (San Diego)   shell model
    J. Vary            (Iowa)   nuclear forces, ab initio shell model
    A. Schwenk    (Darmstadt)   nuclear forces, ab initio shell model
    S. Lenzi           (Padova)      experiment, shell model calc.
    R.V.F. Janssens    (ANL)     experiment
    F. Azaiez         (Capetown)   experiment 
    M. Lewitowitz  (GANIL)        experiment
where nobody in Tokyo, MSU or Leuven is included. 

Regarding referee A, we are concerned that the negative suggestion for 
transferring to PRC Rapid Communications is not among the usual tasks
which a referee is asked for by the editors.  This suggestion implies strong 
intention so as to cut down the impact of this work as much as possible.  
This is a very subjective behavior, and we ask you to remain fair, 
especially if referee A is among those who are competitors AND do not 
like developments by us.  If you could avoid, 
   F. Nowacki, C. Seija, E. Caurier, A. Zuker and A. Poves,
the situation could be securer.  They are good physicists, but may not 
be suitable as fair referees.  

With our best regards,

N. Tsunoda, T. Otsuka, N. Shimizu, M. H.-Jensen, K, Takayanagi and T. Suzuki

A summary of major changes and reply to Referee A

We thank Referee A for his/her positive report on the present paper. 
Referee A found that the physics of this manuscript is sound.
He/She raised, however, a question whether this work was a mere 
application of some method to some new group of nuclei or not.
We have worked hard so that really new and innovative points can 
be clearly presented on a very firm basis.   
For this purpose, we not only improved the manuscript but also 
carried out some additional calculations which are more difficult than
those presented in the original version of the paper.  

In the revised version, we made the following major changes.

1) The pattern of particle-hole excitations over Z=N=20 gap is discussed
to a good detail.
It has been a long-standing issue how these excitations occur in exotic 
nuclei, especially in the island of inversion.
In the conventional picture, for instance, the Warburton-Brown-Becker’s 
island-of-inversion model, the ground state of 32Mg is basically of 2p2h 
excitation.  This feature remains in other shell-model calculations made 
later.   The present work is really the first work to investigate  
this pattern based on the microscopic nuclear forces.
The result shows two aspects, as written in the revised manuscript.
In the first aspect, the 2p2h picture is incorrect.  The right description is 
that the ground-state wave function of 32Mg is comprised of various 
particle-hole components centered at 4p4h with wide distribution.
Physical observables can be well described by this kind of wave 
functions.
  
In the second aspect, however, this pattern can be interpreted as a 
combination of dynamical 2p2h + background modest 2p2h excitations.  
In the actual quantitative calculations, these two are mixed and 
indistinguishable.   On the other hand, from systematic changes, 
one can find two basic underlying trends.  If one focuses on the 
dynamical part, the conventional description can be viewed as an 
intuitive interpretation.   The manuscript has been revised to show 
such discussions: four paragraphs are added from the beginning of 
the right column of page 3 till the beginning of the left column of 
page 4.   Figure 2 has been enlarged so that its panels (c,d) exhibit 
how much such particle-hole excitations occur in the ground states 
of Mg isotopes.

2) The present work can give two-body matrix elements connecting 
the sd and pf shells from the microscopic basis.   Thus, it can play 
a crucial role in the description of transitional nuclei like 31Mg.   
The level scheme of 31Mg has been added as Fig. 3.   For 31Mg, 
the above-mentioned connecting two-body matrix elements are 
particularly important even for the ground and lowest states, but 
phenomenological fit (of the quality of other groups of nuclei) 
is infeasible because of too many parameters and too few data.  
On the other hand, the levels of 31Mg can be reproduced very well 
by the present work (without fit, of course).
Thus, the present work paves the way to the precise understanding 
and description of more exotic nuclei which are beyond the limit of 
phenomenological fit.

3) Because of these additions, the old Fig. 4 has been removed.
The old Fig. 3 has been reduced, and has become Fig. 4.   
The relevant texts have been changed accordingly.

4) Some other parts of the texts have been modified.   For instance, 
the abstract and summary section have been revised, for instance, 
by mentioning the long-standing issue of particle-hole excitations 
and its solution.

Since the present work solves the long-standing puzzle regarding the 
island of inversion, one of the major issues of nuclear physics, and 
introduces a novel way for the description of exotic nuclei in general, 
this manuscript should have become suitable for the publication 
in Phys. Rev. Lett.  This point was not so well presented in the first 
version, and we are grateful to Referee A for demanding this kind of 
improvement.

Referee A suggested two concrete changes.   The text corresponding 
to the first change has been removed.  So this change is not necessary.
The second suggestion, from “filling” to “normal filling”, has been 
incorporated exactly as suggested.

Thus, we believe that the revised manuscript has become suitable 
for the publication in Phys. Rev. Lett.

reply to Referee B

This reply is ONLY for the editors of PRL, and is NOT intended to be 
sent to Referee B.

Referee B discussed advanced details of microscopic nuclear forces,
but the report is not so relevant to our work.  In our work,
basic nuclear forces are used as inputs to define our effective
Hamiltonians used in large-scale nuclear structure calculations.  
In our work we have, as done by many other nuclear many-body theorists, employed
state-of-the-art models for the nuclear forces. This is a common
procedure, as seen in many other works published in the Physical
Review Letters or Physical Review C (see for example
Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 072501).  We are obviously familiar with 
the present theoretical shortcomings
of the various models of nuclear forces, but if we were to adopt referee B's approach,
most likely there would be no articles that could be published in nuclear structure. 
We feel the criticism is not relevant to our present work. However, 
since it is rather unlikely that 
Referee B will change her/his strong (personal) standpoint regarding 
nuclear forces, it may be  more productive to look for a more 
appropriate referee.
