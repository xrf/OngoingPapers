Spectroscopic Information near N=14,16
(all sections should be completed)
Physics Justification
Recent advances in ab initio calculations have resulted in the ability to calculate the properties of nuclei with mass greater than 20 [cite]. These advances place more emphasis on the need to have spectroscopic information detailing nuclear structure near the neutron dripline. In particular, there is little known about nuclei one to two protons away from the potentially doubly magic 22O and the doubly magic 24O.
In the case of 22O, much has been studied experimentally with respect to neutron degrees of freedom, with the primary aim being identifying whether or not the N=14 subshell gap is magic [THI00,STA04,BEC06]. The experimental data, however, is lacking for nuclei that vary by one proton from 22O. For example, since 21N was first observed in 1970 [ART70] only two experiments have been performed to identify excited states of this nucleus [SOH08,ELE10]. In the case of Ref. [SOH08] five excited states were observed by two step fragmentation and were given tentative spin-parity assignments. Similarly, excited states have been measured in 23F three times [ORR89,AZA02,MIC06]. Most recently a series of four reactions were used to populate excited states, including single and multi-nucleon knockout, proton transfer, and inelastic scattering [MIC06]. These measurements resulted in an analysis of the angular distributions of charged particles from the (4He,t) transfer reaction which led to the determination of spectroscopic factors for two of the observed states. For both 23F and 21N, there are no firm spin-parity assignments, and spectroscopic factors are either unknown (21N) or unconfirmed (23F).  A more thorough study of the excited states in 23F and 21N, including firm spin-parity assignments and measurements of spectroscopic factors, would provide valuable data for ab initio calculations.
Approaching the neutron dripline with 24O, the experimental data becomes more scarce. Although 25F was also first observed in 1970 [ART70] and several gamma rays were observed in the early 2000â€™s [BEL01,AZA02,ELE04], the first detailed spectroscopy of excited states in 25F was not published until 2014 [VAJ14]. In Ref [VAJ14] seven gamma-rays are identified corresponding to five excited states.  The states are given tentative spin-parity assignments, but due to the nature of the fragmentation reaction employed, spectroscopic factors were not determined.
Performing single proton knockout reactions with beams of radioactive 24,26Ne and 22O will provide a critical means to further develop the current understanding of the structure of neutron rich isotopes near N=14 and N=16. By probing the largely mysterious proton shell structure in this region in a systematic way, as a function of changing isospin, we will gain valuable, currently unknown, knowledge on the structure of the excited states of 23F, 21N, and 25F, as well as information concerning the ground state configuration of the potentially doubly magic 22O. 


Goals of the proposed experiment
The primary goal of this experiment is to measure the spectroscopic factors and spin-parities of single particle states in 23F, 21N, and 25F near the N=14 and N=16 magic numbers. By measuring proton knockout from radioactive 24,26Ne we will be able to determine the spectroscopic factors of the low lying states in 23,25F. This information is crucial to the further development of ab initio models aiming to correctly describe the behavior of the oxygen, and near oxygen isotopes as they approach the dripline. In addition to the knockout from Ne, proton knockout reactions will also be performed using a radioactive 22O beam, and a stable 16O beam.  The aim of these reactions will be to understand the underlying structure of the oxygen isotopes. These measurements will further allow us to characterize the nature of the ground state of the potentially doubly magic 22O isotope. At the same time, we will be able to identify excited states in 21N, and make spin-parity assignments and determine spectroscopic factors to these states. Information on these neutron dripline nuclei is crucial for the development of next generation theoretical models.
