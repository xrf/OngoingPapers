Starting job 5887463 ("5887385.20") on c3-29 at Tue Apr 22 16:14:04 CEST 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: It appears that your OpenFabrics subsystem is configured to only
allow registering part of your physical memory.  This can cause MPI jobs to
run with erratic performance, hang, and/or crash.

This may be caused by your OpenFabrics vendor limiting the amount of
physical memory that can be registered.  You should investigate the
relevant Linux kernel module parameters that control how much physical
memory can be registered, and increase them to allow registering all
physical memory on your machine.

See this Open MPI FAQ item for more information on these Linux kernel module
parameters:

  Local host:              compute-3-29.local
  Registerable memory:     32768 MiB
  Total memory:            65507 MiB

Your MPI job will continue, but may be behave poorly and/or hang.
