# CC energies of two-dimensional electron gas
#
# rs = 1.0, N = 74, alpha = 0.4
# nShells = Number of sp energy shells
# ene_ref = Reference energy per particle in units
#           of rydberg (e^2/(2*a_{0})) 
# ene_corr = CCD correlation energy
#
# NB! Values with nShells >= 100 may be 
# unsufficiently converged, since the 
# limit of maximum number of iterations
# was chosen too small. These points
# must be recalculated.
