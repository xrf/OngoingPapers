# Addition and removal energies (DMC)
#
# num_filled: number of shells fully occupied by electrons;
# The number of electrons is given by num_filled * (num_filled + 1).
#
# freq: frequency of the harmonic oscillator potential in atomic units.
#
# is_hole: whether the row denotes addition energy or removal energy;
# 0 => addition, 1 => removal.
#
# energy: value of addition/removal energy in atomic units.
